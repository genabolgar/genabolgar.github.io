        <p>Have you ever sat next to a family member at a summer get together,<br> and midway through your usual “life-update” exchange, you start realizing<br> that even though you love them, you don’t really know them?<br>
        <br>
        I have. It happens to me all the time.<br>
        <br>
        Most recently, it was Memorial Day, and I was sitting at a beach picnic<br> with my tío Nick. Nick is my tall, cheery, mustachioed great uncle,<br> who grows heirloom tomatoes and calls me muchacha. He’s married<br> to my tía Esther, my grandma’s little sister, and has been at every family<br> gathering since 1971, decades before I was born. When I was in<br> elementary school, he and my tía would take me on spontaneous<br> trips to McDonalds and the movies and show me how to make tortillas<br> from scratch. He’s actually one of my favorite uncles.<br>
<br>
But if you were to ask me what his favorite color was, or his middle name.<br> I. Could. Not. Tell. You. I know! The shame!<br>
<br>
As we sat side-by-side by the ocean, I realized I wanted to move past knowing<br> the uncle version of him that I’d known for the past 30 years. I decided to be<br> intentional and ask him the kinds of questions that I’d ask a new friend:<br>
<ul>
    <li>
     Who’s the #1 musician, dead or alive, that you’d see live in concert?   
    </li>
    
    
    <li>
      What dish could you eat every day for the rest of your life?  
    </li>
    
    
    <li>
    What’s one of your favorite childhood memories?    
    </li>
    
</ul>
        </p>

        <p>The first time I’d tested out this method was years ago with my then-13-year-old<br> brother, Sam. We were driving to get frozen yogurt, and I noticed him<br> humming and tapping along to The Avett Brothers. It suddenly struck me:<br> he’s an actual human with his own life, dreams, and insecurities. He’s not<br> just my baby brother. Instead of asking personal questions as his protectiv<br>e older sister, I asked him more unexpected questions like, what’s a movie<br> you could quote in your sleep? Or, which celebrity would you invite for dinner?<br> After that conversation, a switch flipped in our relationship. Because I took<br> a break from my role as the bossy older brother, Sam started opening up<br> to me about his world.
        <br>

During my informal interview of tío Nick on the beach, we talked about his<br> rose and vegetable garden. I learned that starting an avocado tree is as simple<br> as sticking three toothpicks into a pit and keeping it in a mason jar. And he<br> shared how he knew he was going to marry Esther the moment he laid eyes<br> on her in the high school cafeteria.<br>

To be honest, I still don’t know Nick’s middle name or favorite color. But his<br> life feels a lot more real and less mysterious to me. And I’m excited to learn more.<br>
    Things I that learn about Nick's favorite places and foods.
